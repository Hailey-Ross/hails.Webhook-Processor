# 🎶 hails.Webhook-Processor
Azuracast's built-in webhook integration is limited and lacks basic customization.  
**hails.Webhook-Processor** acts as a **translation layer**, giving you **full control** over webhook messages sent to **Discord**.

## 📥 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone or Download the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Hailey-Ross/hails.Webhook-Processor.git
cd hails.Webhook-Processor
```

### 2️⃣ Configure the .env File
###### 🔒 Keep this file private! Do not share it. 
Create a .env file to store API keys and webhook settings.  
This file should not be accessible to anyone on the web or in your webserver.  
```sh
AZURACAST_WEBHOOK_KEY=your-secure-key
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url
```

### 3️⃣ Edit AzuraCord
Edit AzuraCord.php to include the path to the new .env file on your webserver:

```sh
$envFile = "/path/to/env/file/webhook.env"; //Update to your actual secure path that you have stored your .env file at
```

### 4️⃣ Deploy & Connect to AzuraCast
###### 🛑 DO NOT use the default your-secure-key value, if you have. Go back to the previous step. Seriously.
Upload AzuraCord.php to your web server.
Set AzuraCast's Webhook URL to:

```sh
https://yourdomain.com/AzuraCord.php?key=your-secure-key
```
